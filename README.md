<h1>Ian MacKinnon <br/><a>Engineer - West Point Alum - Baseball Enthusiast</a></h1>

<h2> About Me:</h2>
As a life long baseball from from Detroit, I've had several unique opportunities to see the inner workings of the game. I spent three seasons as a Bat Boy for the Detroit Tigers, getting an up close and personal
look at one of the most talented rosters of the mid-2000's. I stayed involved with baseball once I left for college, working as a Student Manager for the Army Baseball team during my time studying at West Point. Upon graduating as an Army Officer, I began a career centered on risk evaluation and mitigation as a bomb deefusal technician. I was ultimately selected in to the DoD's only Special Mission Unit trained to operate on hostile nuclear weapons, taking my experiences with risk to the pinnacle of my profession. After sustaining a career ending injury, I transitioned into Hypersonic Engineering, working on R&D rocket launches for one of the  nation's largest National Laboratories while also pursuing a Masters in Applied Data Science in my free time. It is this combination of risk, engineering, and a love for the game that I now aim to bring together in a career in baseball.
